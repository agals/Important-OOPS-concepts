A constructor is a special member function in object-oriented programming languages that is used to initialize objects of a class.
It is called automatically when an object is created or instantiated. 
The constructor's purpose is to set the initial state of the object by assigning values to its member variables or performing any other necessary initialization tasks.
Constructors play a crucial role in object-oriented programming as they ensure that objects are properly initialized before they are used. 
They help in creating instances of a class with desired initial values and provide a way to encapsulate the initialization logic within the class itself.


Example:

class Employee:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

# Creating an instance of the Person class using the constructor
emp1 = Employee("Alice", 25)

# Accessing the object's properties
print(emp1.name)  # Output: Alice
print(emp1.age)   # Output: 25
In the above example, the Employee class has a constructor __init__() that takes two parameters: name and age. 
Inside the constructor, the values of name and age are assigned to the corresponding instance variables (self.name and self.age).

When we create an instance of the Person class using the constructor (person1 = Person("Alice", 25)), 
the constructor is automatically called, and the instance variables name and age are initialized with the provided values.
