Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a class to inherit or acquire the properties and behaviors (methods and attributes) of another class. 
The class from which the properties and behaviors are inherited is called the "parent class".
while the class that inherits them is known as the "child class".
When a child class inherits from a parent class, it automatically gains access to all the public and protected members (methods and attributes) of the parent class.
This means that the child class can use and override these inherited members, as well as add new members of its own.
