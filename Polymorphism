Polymorphism is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. 
It refers to the ability of an object to take on many forms or to exhibit multiple behaviors.

In the context of OOP, polymorphism enables objects to respond to methods and operations in different ways based on their specific class or type, while still adhering to a common interface or superclass. 
This concept promotes code reusability, flexibility, and extensibility.

Polymorphism is typically achieved through two mechanisms:

Method Overriding:
  Subclasses can provide their own implementation of methods defined in their superclass. 
  When a method is invoked on an object, the specific implementation of that method based on the object's actual class is executed.

Method Overloading:
  Multiple methods can have the same name but differ in their parameter types or the number of parameters they accept.  
  The appropriate method to execute is determined based on the arguments passed during the method invocation.

By leveraging polymorphism, you can write code that operates on objects of various types without needing to know their specific classes, as long as they share a common interface or superclass. 
This flexibility simplifies code maintenance, promotes modular design, and allows for the creation of reusable and interchangeable components.
