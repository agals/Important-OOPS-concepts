A stack is an abstract data type that represents a collection of elements with a particular behavior known as the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. 
In a stack, elements are added and removed from only one end called the "top" of the stack.

The stack operates based on two fundamental operations:

Push: This operation adds an element to the top of the stack. 
The new element becomes the most recently added item and is placed above all the other elements.

Pop: This operation removes and returns the topmost element from the stack.
The element that was added most recently is the first one to be removed.

Additional operations can include:
Peek/Top: This operation returns the value of the topmost element without removing it from the stack.

IsEmpty: This operation checks if the stack is empty, i.e., it contains no elements.

Stacks can be implemented using various data structures, such as arrays or linked lists. 
The underlying data structure determines the efficiency of the stack operations.
